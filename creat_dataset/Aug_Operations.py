"""
The Operations module contains classes for all operations used by Augmentor. 

The classes contained in this module are not called or instantiated directly
by the user, instead the user interacts with the 
:class:`~Augmentor.Pipeline.Pipeline` class and uses the utility functions contained 
there. 
 
In this module, each operation is a subclass of type :class:`Operation`.
The :class:`~Augmentor.Pipeline.Pipeline` objects expect :class:`Operation` 
types, and therefore all operations are of type :class:`Operation`, and 
provide their own implementation of the :func:`~Operation.perform_operation`
function.
 
Hence, the documentation for this module is intended for developers who 
wish to extend Augmentor or wish to see how operations function internally.

For detailed information on extending Augmentor, see :ref:`extendingaugmentor`.
